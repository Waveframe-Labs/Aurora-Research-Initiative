# ADR-0003: Separation of Governance Authority from Enforcement Mechanisms

## Context

As ARI evolved toward automated enforcement via CRI-CORE, a risk emerged that tooling could implicitly redefine governance semantics or epistemic correctness.

## Decision

ARI formally separates **governance authority** from **enforcement mechanisms**:

- Governance defines meaning, rules, and legitimacy.
- Enforcement executes deterministic validation and halts on violation.
- Tooling must never interpret, amend, or redefine governance rules.

## Rationale

This separation prevents governance capture by tooling and preserves institutional neutrality, auditability, and long-term adaptability.

## Consequences

- CRI-CORE may halt execution but not adjudicate epistemic correctness.
- Policy changes must precede enforcement changes.
- Tooling implementations may evolve independently of governance.

## Alternatives Considered

- Tool-defined correctness (rejected).
- Embedded governance logic in tooling (rejected).
