# ADR-0001: Metadata Enforcement, Authorship, and Schema Canonicalization

## Context

As the Aurora Research Initiative (ARI) transitioned from an initial governance concept into an operational institution, limitations were identified in Metadata Policy v1.0.0.

Specifically:
- Author attribution was not explicitly required at the policy level.
- Metadata validation rules were partially implicit and tool-dependent.
- Derived artifacts (e.g., rendered PDFs) could lose authoritative metadata.
- The separation between governance policy and enforcement mechanisms was not formally recorded.

These gaps produced artifacts that were structurally valid but institutionally ambiguous, undermining provenance guarantees and auditability.

## Decision

ARI adopts **Metadata Policy v2.0.0** as binding institutional law with the following decisions:

1. Mandatory author attribution for all governed artifacts.
2. Explicit prohibition on AI systems being listed as authors.
3. Required disclosure of AI assistance using a structured schema.
4. Canonicalization of the JSON Schema as the machine-enforceable specification.
5. Formal separation of governance policy from enforcement tooling.
6. Mandatory inheritance of metadata by derived artifacts.
7. Governance-level versioning for metadata rule changes.

## Rationale

These decisions ensure institutional authority resides in declared policy rather than tooling or individuals. Canonical schemas enable deterministic validation while remaining subordinate to governance law.

## Consequences

- Artifacts lacking required metadata are institutionally invalid.
- Existing repositories must be revised to achieve compliance.
- Tooling may flag or reject non-compliant artifacts but must not modify authoritative content.
- Future governance changes require ADRs prior to enforcement.

## Alternatives Considered

- Tool-defined metadata rules (rejected).
- Optional author attribution (rejected).
- Full AI provenance disclosure (rejected).
- Backward-compatibility exemptions (rejected).

## Enforcement Boundary

This ADR does not prescribe enforcement tooling. Validation mechanisms are implementation concerns provided they conform to ARI policy.
