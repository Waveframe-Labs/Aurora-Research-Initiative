# ADR-0002: Adoption of Core Governance Stack (Genesis)

## Context

ARI requires a binding governance foundation to prevent role bleeding, ensure reproducibility, and enable deterministic enforcement. Prior to this decision, governance existed implicitly across documents without a formal ratification event.

## Decision

ARI formally ratifies the following documents as the **Core Governance Stack (v1.x)**:

1. Governance Model
2. ARI Boundaries & Responsibilities
3. Role Separation Charter
4. Epistemic Doctrine
5. Change Control & Versioning Policy
6. Method Constraints
7. Tooling Constraints
8. Metadata Policy

## Consequences

### Positive
- Governance authority is formally established.
- Enforcement by CRI-CORE derives legitimacy.
- All future changes require ADRs and version control.

### Negative
- Increased governance overhead.
- No informal hotfixes permitted.

## Compliance

All governed repositories must comply with Metadata Policy v2.0.0. A Global Ecosystem Release Tag will be issued following ratification.

## Sign-off

Ratified by ARI Institutional Authority on 2025-12-12.
