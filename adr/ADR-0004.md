# ADR-0004: Adoption of Metadata Policy v3.0.0 and Canonical Metadata Schema Revision

**Status:** Accepted (Governance Binding)  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Supersedes:** Metadata Policy v2.0.0  
**Governance Layer:** ARI (Institutional Law)  
**Affected Systems:** ARI, AWO, CRI-CORE, Stamp  

---

## 1. Context

The previous metadata policy (v2.0.0) lacked strict enforcement boundaries, allowed permissive field structures, and did not define mandatory DOI usage, structured authorship, dependency linking, or anchor semantics. Documentation produced during AWO v2.0.0 demonstrated the need for a deterministic, machine-readable metadata schema to support automated validation, reproducibility guarantees, and future enforcement via Stamp and CRI-CORE.

Without a stricter schema, metadata remained partially informal, tool-specific behavior could drift away from governance, and downstream validation could not reliably be automated.

---

## 2. Decision

The Aurora Research Initiative formally adopts **Metadata Policy v3.0.0** as the authoritative and binding metadata specification for all governed artifacts. This decision includes:

1. **New required fields**
   - `filetype`, `type`, `doi`, `dependencies`, `anchors`
   - structured `author`, `maintainer`, and `copyright`

2. **Updated enums and validation rules**
   - `ai_assisted` enum updated to `none`, `partial`, `extensive`
   - `filetype`, `type`, and `status` restricted to explicit, documented sets

3. **Mandatory DOI usage**
   - concept DOIs required for root/README and concept-level documents
   - version DOIs required for versioned artifacts
   - `TBD-x.y.z` placeholders allowed prior to release

4. **Dependency and anchor semantics**
   - all governed artifacts must declare valid relative-path dependencies
   - anchors must follow the canonical format  
     `<SYSTEM>-<DOCUMENT>-v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>`

5. **Date and lifecycle rules**
   - `created` is immutable
   - `updated` required on each revision
   - dates must follow ISO-8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`)

6. **Schema strictness**
   - the metadata block is treated as a closed schema
   - additional arbitrary fields are disallowed at the governance level
   - extensions, if needed, must go through formal governance

---

## 3. Rationale

This revision provides a deterministic, machine-validatable metadata framework that:

- improves **reproducibility** by forcing explicit attribution, versioning, and DOIs  
- enables **automated validation** by Stamp and CRI-CORE  
- aligns governance with actual practice in AWO v2.0.0  
- removes ambiguity around authorship, maintainership, and provenance  
- enables construction of consistent dependency and anchor graphs across artifacts  
- creates a stable surface for future institutionalization and external adoption

The enforcement boundary between governance and tooling remains intact:  
**ARI defines the law; Stamp and CRI-CORE implement validation and enforcement.**

---

## 4. Consequences

### Positive

- Unified metadata schema across Aurora systems  
- Clear contract for automation and enforcement tooling  
- Stronger auditability and provenance chains  
- Easier external adoption of Aurora-style metadata via Stamp

### Costs / Risks

- Backward-incompatible change: v2.x-compliant metadata is noncompliant under v3.0.0  
- Existing repositories require normalization to fully align with the new schema  
- Tooling must be updated to respect stricter validation rules  

### Mitigation

- Normalization is expected to be automated by **Stamp** (initial versions may operate in advisory mode)
- Retroactive updates are recommended for revised documents but not required immediately
- Governance logs and this ADR provide durable provenance for the breaking change

---

## 5. Status

This ADR is **accepted and binding**.

- Metadata Policy v3.0.0 is the canonical metadata specification for all governed artifacts.
- Future Aurora repositories and revisions MUST conform to this schema.
- Enforcement engines (Stamp, CRI-CORE) MUST treat this ADR and the policy it references as their authoritative contract.
