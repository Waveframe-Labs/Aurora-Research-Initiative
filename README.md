# Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)

The **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** is the governance and epistemic framework that
oversees the development of the **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** method, the
**CRI-CORE** deterministic engine, and the initiative’s scientific case studies  
(e.g., Waveframe v4.0 and the Societal Progress Simulator).

ARI establishes the institutional layer required for reproducible AI-human research:
governance rules, identity anchoring, provenance norms, metadata policy, documentation
standards, and the philosophical foundation that guides the entire ecosystem.

---

## 1. Purpose

ARI serves as the **institutional backbone** of the Aurora ecosystem.  
It defines:

- governance structure and role separation  
- epistemic doctrine for audit-first science  
- metadata and provenance requirements  
- evolutionary roadmap for AWO, CRI-CORE, and related research  
- integration principles for scientific case studies  
- open-science and reproducibility philosophy  

---

## 2. Position in the Ecosystem

ARI sits **above** all technical and scientific layers:
```
Waveframe Labs (organization)
└── Aurora Research Initiative (institutional governance)
├── AWO — workflow method and audit-first execution
├── CRI-CORE — deterministic tooling engine (in development)
└── Case Studies
├── Waveframe v4.0 (cosmology)
└── Societal Progress Simulator
```

ARI is *not* a workflow, *not* a codebase, and *not* a scientific model.  
It is the **governance layer that defines the rules** for all other components.

---

## 3. Current Development Status

ARI is in **early architecture stabilization**.  
The following documents will be added as they are finalized:

- `ARI_ARCHITECTURE.md` — formal institutional architecture  
- `GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md` — role separation, decision rules, oversight  
- `EPISTEMIC_DOCTRINE.md` — audit-first science, falsifiability, provenance  
- `INIT_LOG.md` — chronological development log  
- `ANCHORS/` — stable anchor tags for governance events  
- `ROADMAP.md` — evolution of AWO, CRI-CORE, and institutional processes  

No licenses have been applied yet.  
Licensing will be determined once the document structure is stable.

## 4. Guiding Principles

ARI is founded on a set of evolving principles:

1. **Audit-first epistemology**  
   Scientific claims must be validated through recorded, verifiable processes.

2. **Role separation**  
   No single entity controls method, tooling, execution, and governance.

3. **Deterministic provenance**  
   Artifacts must be reconstructible and identity-verified.

4. **Human-in-the-loop oversight**  
   Human reasoning remains necessary for interpretation and falsifiability.

5. **Institutional independence**  
   Governance must remain independent of any single workflow or tool.

---

## 5. Repository Structure (initial)
```
/README.md
/architecture/ (institutional architecture docs)
/governance/ (governance model, roles, rules)
/epistemics/ (epistemic doctrine)
/anchors/ (stable anchor tags)
/logs/ (INIT_LOG, GOV_LOG)
/roadmap/ (initiative evolution)
```

This structure will evolve as ARI stabilizes.

---

## 6. Relationship to External Projects

The following repositories operate under ARI governance:

- **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**  
- **CRI-CORE** (under development)  
- **Waveframe v4.0** — observer-aware cosmology  
- **Societal Progress Simulator** — societal modeling framework  

Each project maintains operational independence but adheres to ARI’s governance and epistemic rules.
