# Aurora Research Initiative — Roadmap (v1.1.0)

This roadmap defines the strategic evolution of the **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)** across
multiple phases. It establishes how ARI grows from its foundational architecture into a fully mature
institution governing reproducible AI–human scientific workflows and tooling.

The roadmap is descriptive, not authoritative; governance authority is defined by ARI constitutional
documents. This file exists to provide planning clarity and long-horizon coherence.

---

## 1. Phase I — Foundational Architecture (Completed)

**Objective:** Establish ARI as an independent institutional governance layer.

**Delivered:**
- ARI repository creation  
- `README.md`  
- `architecture/ARI_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
- Core governance documents  
- `INIT_LOG.md`  
- Governance logging framework  
- Baseline folder structure  

**Completion Criteria (Satisfied):**
- Governance baseline stable  
- Architecture baseline established  
- Provenance chain active  
- No unresolved structural inconsistencies  

---

## 2. Phase II — Metadata & Epistemic Foundations (Completed)

**Objective:** Define the epistemic rules and metadata structures governing the Aurora ecosystem.

**Delivered:**
- `EPISTEMIC_DOCTRINE.md`  
- `METADATA_POLICY.md`  
- Governance normalization and compliance audit  

**Outcomes:**
- Audit-first epistemology codified  
- Metadata structure standardized  
- Provenance expectations formalized  
- Machine-valid governance artifacts  

**Dependencies:**  
Phase I

---

## 3. Phase III — Integration with AWO (In Progress)

**Objective:** Ensure Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO) is fully aligned with ARI governance.

**Focus Areas:**
- Governance compliance criteria for workflows  
- Metadata enforcement expectations  
- Role separation boundaries  
- Removal of implicit governance from method logic  

**Goals:**
- AWO adopts ARI policies explicitly  
- Method and governance boundaries enforced  
- Reasoning pipelines remain auditable  

**Dependencies:**  
Phase II

---

## 4. Phase IV — CRI-CORE Alignment & Enforcement Transition (Planned)

**Objective:** Transition deterministic execution and enforcement from AWO into CRI-CORE.

**Planned Deliverables:**
- Deterministic tooling requirements  
- Identity-binding and attestation rules  
- Provenance verification criteria  
- CRI-CORE onboarding and conformance guidance  

**Goals:**
- Clear separation between method (AWO) and engine (CRI)  
- Enforcement authority exercised mechanically  
- Reproducibility guarantees hardened  

**Dependencies:**  
Phase III

---

## 5. Phase V — Governance Maturity & Public Transparency (Planned)

**Objective:** Formalize ARI as a public-facing governance institution.

**Planned Deliverables:**
- Public governance documentation  
- Licensing strategy  
- ARI web presence  
- Governance maturity model  
- Transparency dashboards  

**Outcomes:**
- Public trust  
- Transparent accountability  
- Institution-level clarity  

**Dependencies:**  
Phases I–IV

---

## 6. Phase VI — Certification & Ecosystem Expansion (Long-Term)

**Objective:** Establish ARI as a recognized standard for reproducible scientific workflows.

**Key Initiatives:**
- Reproducibility certification framework  
- Multi-agent governance expansion  
- External collaboration guidelines  
- Case study ecosystem growth  

**Long-Term Outcomes:**
- Institutional credibility  
- Broad adoption of ARI-aligned governance  
- AWO and CRI-CORE recognized as research infrastructure  

---

## 7. Revision & Governance

All roadmap changes must:

- comply with ARI Metadata Policy  
- be logged in `GOVERNANCE_LOG.md`  
- include rationale and dependency notes  
- preserve backward traceability  

No silent revisions permitted.

This roadmap provides a non-authoritative planning view of ARI’s institutional evolution.
