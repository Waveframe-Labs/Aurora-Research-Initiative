## 2025-12-12 — GOVERNANCE NORMALIZATION & COMPLIANCE AUDIT

**Event:** Full Governance Review and ARI Compliance Normalization  

**Scope:**  
Comprehensive review and revision of all governance-layer documents to align with:
- ARI Metadata Policy v2.0.0  
- Change Control and Versioning Policy  
- Explicit role separation and enforcement boundaries  

**Documents Revised:**  
- ARI Architecture Document → v1.1.0  
- Governance Model → v1.1.1  
- Change Control and Versioning Policy → v1.1.1  
- ARI Boundaries and Responsibilities → v1.1.1  
- Role Separation Charter → v1.1.1  
- Method Constraints → v1.1.1  
- Tooling Constraints → v1.1.1  
- Metadata Policy → v2.0.x (manual correction)  

**Key Decisions:**  
- Clarified enforcement authority of CRI-CORE, including execution halt on integrity failure  
- Distinguished semantic determinism from bitwise determinism  
- Formalized metadata transport vs. generation constraints  
- Added role-assumption (hat-switching) protocol for early single-actor phases  
- Standardized metadata fields, enums, and dependencies across governance artifacts  

**Version State:**  
- ARI_VERSION: 1.1.0  
- Global Ecosystem Release Tag: To be issued after Epistemic Doctrine alignment  

**Rationale:**  
Ensured internal consistency, technical realizability, and full ARI compliance across the governance layer prior to institutional sealing.
