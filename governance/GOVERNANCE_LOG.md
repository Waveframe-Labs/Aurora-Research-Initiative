## 2025-12-12 — ADR RATIFICATION: CORE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS

**Event:** Ratification of Architecture Decision Records (ADR-0001–ADR-0003)

**Details:**  
The following Architecture Decision Records were formally ratified and adopted as binding governance decisions of the Aurora Research Initiative:
- ADR-0001: Metadata Enforcement, Authorship, and Schema Canonicalization
- ADR-0002: Adoption of Core Governance Stack (Genesis)
- ADR-0003: Separation of Governance Authority from Enforcement Mechanisms

These ADRs collectively:
- establish Metadata Policy v2.0.0 as institutional law
- formally adopt the ARI Core Governance Stack
- codify the separation between governance authority and deterministic enforcement

**Version State:**   
- ARI_VERSION: 2.0.0
- Global Ecosystem Release Tag: Pending issuance

**Rationale:**  
These decisions represent irreversible institutional commitments required to prevent governance drift, ensure auditability, and legitimize deterministic enforcement by CRI-CORE. Formal ADR ratification provides durable provenance for governance authority and future audits.
