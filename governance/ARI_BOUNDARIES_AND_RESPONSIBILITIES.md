# ARI Boundaries and Responsibilities

## Purpose

This document defines the **jurisdictional boundaries**, **responsibilities**, and **explicit
prohibitions** governing interactions between ARI, AWO, CRI-CORE, Waveframe Labs, and all affiliated
case studies.

Its purpose is to enforce separation of authority, prevent role bleeding, and provide a binding
reference for audits, dispute resolution, and institutional evolution.

---

## 1. ARI — Governance and Epistemic Authority

### Responsibilities

ARI is responsible for:

- Adopting and ratifying epistemic doctrine and compliance standards
- Defining governance rules and authority boundaries
- Establishing metadata, provenance, and identity requirements
- Imposing constraints on AWO and CRI-CORE operation
- Approving governance-impacting structural changes
- Ensuring independence of validation and enforcement

### Explicit Prohibitions

ARI may **not**:

- Implement method logic or workflows
- Implement deterministic execution or enforcement
- Interpret scientific data or adjudicate scientific truth
- Build or operate tooling
- Execute research workflows
- Self-ratify governance changes without logs and ADRs

ARI governs.  
ARI does not build, execute, or enforce.

---

## 2. AWO — Method and Workflow Framework

### Responsibilities

AWO is responsible for:

- Translating ARI and epistemic requirements into procedural workflow logic
- Orchestrating reasoning steps in a structured, auditable manner
- Producing workflow artifacts subject to ARI legitimacy rules
- Performing metadata generation, subject to validation and encapsulation by CRI-CORE

### Explicit Prohibitions

AWO may **not**:

- Define or modify epistemic doctrine
- Approve governance or policy changes
- Interpret scientific correctness
- Embed deterministic enforcement or identity binding
- Override metadata or provenance obligations
- Bypass ARI-imposed constraints

AWO executes method.  
AWO does not govern, enforce, or validate.

---

## 3. CRI-CORE — Deterministic Execution and Enforcement Engine

### Responsibilities

CRI-CORE is responsible for:

- Deterministic execution of workflows
- Integrity verification and identity binding
- Attestation independence checks
- Reproducible environment capture
- **Halting execution when integrity or provenance validation fails**

### Explicit Prohibitions

CRI-CORE may **not**:

- Interpret scientific or logical meaning
- Alter workflow logic or method structure
- Define epistemic or governance rules
- Approve or reject scientific claims
- Modify metadata definitions
- Act as a reasoning or decision-making system

CRI-CORE enforces execution integrity.  
CRI-CORE does not reason, decide, or govern.

---

## 4. Waveframe Labs — Engineering and Implementation

### Responsibilities

Waveframe Labs is responsible for:

- Developing and maintaining tooling, methods, engines, simulators, and demonstrations
- Implementing AWO and CRI-CORE under ARI governance
- Maintaining repositories and infrastructure
- Producing applied case studies

### Explicit Prohibitions

Waveframe Labs may **not**:

- Define or modify epistemic doctrine
- Override ARI governance or policy
- Alter metadata or provenance requirements
- Collapse method and enforcement layers
- Approve governance-level decisions

Waveframe Labs builds under ARI authority.

---

## 5. Case Studies — Applied Research

### Responsibilities

Case studies are responsible for:

- Applying AWO workflows
- Operating under CRI-CORE enforcement
- Producing reproducible, auditable scientific artifacts
- Demonstrating the Aurora ecosystem in practice

### Explicit Prohibitions

Case studies may **not**:

- Modify governance or epistemic rules
- Alter core method logic or enforcement behavior
- Bypass provenance or metadata requirements
- Self-govern under any circumstances

Case studies demonstrate.  
They do not govern, interpret, or enforce.

---

## 6. Interfaces and Permissions

| Layer | Permitted Modifications | Prohibited Modifications |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **ARI** | Governance, doctrine, constraints | Method logic, CRI internals |
| **AWO** | Workflow logic | Governance, epistemics, enforcement |
| **CRI-CORE** | Deterministic enforcement | Workflow logic, epistemics, governance |
| **Waveframe Labs** | Tooling and demos | ARI doctrine, governance |
| **Case Studies** | Applied research artifacts | Core logic or governance policy |

---

## 7. Forbidden Cross-Layer Interactions

The following interactions are prohibited:

- Method or tooling layers interpreting governance
- Enforcement systems defining method or epistemics
- Engineering layers modifying governance artifacts
- Case studies altering upstream systems
- Any layer self-approving structural changes
- Any silent or undocumented modification
- Any bypass of provenance or metadata policy

Violations constitute governance failures.

---

## 8. Revisions

Revisions to this document REQUIRE:

1. Institutional Coordinator approval
2. Architecture Decision Record (if governance-impacting)
3. Governance log entry
4. Semantic version increment
5. Backward traceability preservation

This document defines the authoritative jurisdictional boundaries and responsibilities of the Aurora
Research Initiative.
