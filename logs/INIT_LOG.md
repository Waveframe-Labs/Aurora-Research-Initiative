# Aurora Research Initiative — Initialization Log (INIT_LOG.md)

This document records the initialization and foundational events of the
**Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)**. All entries in this file are **append-only**
and represent the authoritative provenance chain for ARI’s institutional development.

## Entry 0001 — Establishment of ARI Repository
**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Recorded by:** Institutional Coordinator (Waveframe Labs)

**Summary:**  
The Aurora Research Initiative repository was created to serve as the institutional governance layer
for the Aurora Workflow Orchestration ecosystem (AWO, CRI-CORE, and affiliated scientific case studies).

**Documents established at initialization:**
- `README.md`  
- `architecture/ARI_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
- `governance/GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`  

**Rationale:**  
A dedicated repository is required to:
- prevent governance drift  
- formalize epistemic and institutional structure  
- separate governance from method and tooling layers  
- provide a stable provenance trail  
- ensure clarity for future audits and scientific reproducibility  

**Impact:**  
This marks the beginning of ARI’s formal institutional existence and the foundational commit for all
future governance, epistemic, and architectural expansion.

## Entry 0002 — Activation of Governance Structure
**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Recorded by:** Institutional Coordinator (Waveframe Labs)

**Summary:**  
Initial governance roles and responsibilities were defined within `GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`. This
establishes the first version of:
- role separation  
- oversight logic  
- decision authority model  
- governance prohibitions  
- logging requirements  

**Rationale:**  
Clear governance rules are necessary before AWO stabilization, CRI-CORE implementation, or case
study integration.

**Impact:**  
ARI governance enters v1.0.0 baseline state. All future governance decisions must comply with and be
logged according to this model.

---

## Entry 0003 — Architecture Definition
**Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Recorded by:** Institutional Coordinator (Waveframe Labs)

**Summary:**  
The `ARI_ARCHITECTURE.md` document was created defining ARI’s hierarchical position, interfaces with
AWO and CRI-CORE, and its institutional responsibilities.

**Rationale:**  
A clear architectural understanding is required before metadata policy, epistemic doctrine, or
roadmap development can proceed.

**Impact:**  
The architecture baseline is formally established, enabling next-phase development of governance,
epistemic standards, and enforcement tooling.
